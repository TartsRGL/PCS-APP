# Lesson 4 - Form A & Form B

## Overview

This project is part of the **PCS-APP** course and demonstrates two versions of a user form with a focus on clean structure, accessibility, and progressive enhancements.

## Features

### Form A

* **Basic User Form**: Collects user name, gender, birth date, password, and country.
* **Responsive Layout**: Clean and simple CSS styling.
* **Accessible Design**: ARIA labels for screen readers, optimized label and input connections.
* **Clear Structure**: Logical separation of personal and contact information.

### Form B (to be completed)

* **Extended User Form**: Includes additional fields and enhanced styling.
* **Dynamic Layout**: Advanced CSS for a more interactive design.
* **Additional Input Types**: Checkboxes, text areas, and file upload.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Semantic structure for the forms.
* **CSS** – Responsive and clean design with custom styling.
* **JavaScript (planned)** – For future dynamic interactions in Form B.

## How to Use

1. Open `formA.html` in a browser (Form A).
2. Fill out the form with your details.
3. Submit the form (no backend processing in this demo).
