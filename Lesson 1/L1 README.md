# Lesson 1 - Pancake Configurator

## Overview
This project is part of the **PCS-APP** course and demonstrates an interactive pancake recipe configurator using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Features
- **Dynamic ingredient calculation** based on the number of servings.
- **Dark mode UI** for better aesthetics.
- **JavaScript-based form handling** with real-time updates.
- **Responsive design** for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** â€“ Semantic structure
- **CSS** â€“ Custom styling, dark mode support
- **JavaScript** â€“ Interactive ingredient adjustment

## How to Use
1. Open `config.html` in a browser.
2. Adjust the number of servings using the input field.
3. Ingredients automatically recalculate.
4. Click the reset button to return to the default 3 servings.

## Repository Structure Discussion
If **Lesson 2+** will be similar small-scale projects, keeping them as **subfolders in one repo** makes sense for **course progression tracking**. However, if each lesson is **a standalone project**, creating separate repos (`pcs-lesson1`, `pcs-lesson2`, etc.) provides **better commit clarity** and a cleaner history.

ðŸ”¹ **Recommendation:** Separate repos for major projects, single repo for small exercises.
