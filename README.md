# 🥞 PCS-APP

Welcome to my digital pancake lab.

This repo collects all my projects and exercises from the **Praha Coding School (PCS)** web development course – with a personal twist. Every folder is a lesson. Every lesson is a chaotic combo of original class code + my late-night “what-if” experiments.

## 📚 About the Project

**PCS-APP** was created to:

- Keep my PCS lessons organized (and slightly less messy)
- Go beyond the tutorials and try new things (sometimes they even work)
- Serve as a living portfolio of my web dev journey, one layout bug at a time

📂 Contents:

- [Lesson 1 – Pancake Configurator (HTML, CSS, JS)](./Lesson%201)  
- [Lesson 2 – Organic Product Page + Dynamic Cart](./Lesson%202)  
- [Lesson 3 – Grid vs Flexbox Showdown](./Lesson%203)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Styling:** Responsive layouts with an eye for minimalism (and occasional chaos)  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub – because tracking my confusion is half the fun

## 🚀 How to Explore

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TartsRGL/PCS-APP.git
   ```
2. Dive into a lesson:  
   ```bash
   cd PCS-APP/<lesson-folder>
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser and enjoy the weirdness.

## 🔮 Coming Soon

- More lessons, more layout experiments  
- Cleaner, smarter JS (in theory)  
- Backend explorations (PHP, Laravel, and probably tears)

Huge shoutout to [**Praha Coding School**](https://prahacoding.cz/) and [Mr. Wernerdweight](https://github.com/wernerdweight) – for showing the way, and letting me break things creatively.
