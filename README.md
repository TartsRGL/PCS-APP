# 🥞 PCS-APP

Welcome to my digital pancake lab.

This repo collects all my projects and exercises from the **Praha Coding School (PCS)** web development course – with a personal twist.
Every folder is a lesson. Every lesson is a chaotic combo of original class code + my late-night “what-if” experiments.

## 📚 About the Project

**PCS-APP** was created to:

* Keep my PCS lessons organized (and slightly less messy)
* Go beyond the tutorials and try new things (sometimes they even work)
* Serve as a living portfolio of my web dev journey, one layout bug at a time

📂 Contents:

* [Lesson 1 – Pancake Configurator (HTML, CSS, JS)](./Lesson%201)
* [Lesson 2 – Organic Product Page + Dynamic Cart](./Lesson%202)
* [Lesson 3 – Grid vs Flexbox Showdown](./Lesson%203)
* [Lesson 4 – User Forms (Form A & Form B)](./Lesson%204)  <!-- Added Link to Lesson 4 -->

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Styling:** Responsive layouts with an eye for minimalism (and occasional chaos)
* **Version Control:** Git + GitHub – because tracking my confusion is half the fun

## 🚀 How to Explore

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TartsRGL/PCS-APP.git
   ```
2. Dive into a lesson:

   ```bash
   cd PCS-APP/<lesson-folder>
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser and enjoy the weirdness.

## 🔮 Coming Soon

* More lessons, more layout experiments
* Cleaner, smarter JS (in theory)
* Backend explorations (PHP, Laravel, and probably tears)

## 🙏 Thanks

Huge shoutout to [**Praha Coding School**](https://prahacoding.cz/) and [Mr. Wernerdweight](https://github.com/wernerdweight) – for showing the way, and letting me break things creatively.
* And to all the online resources that helped me figure out what I was doing
 (or not doing) right.
* And to my friends and family for pretending to be impressed by my coding skills.
