# Lesson 3 – Grid vs Flexbox

## Overview  
This project is part of the **PCS-APP** course and demonstrates the practical differences between **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** layout systems. It includes a layout toggle built with JavaScript for real-time switching between both systems.

## Features  
- **Flexbox Example** – Showcases the flexibility and one-dimensional alignment.  
- **Grid Example** – Demonstrates structured two-dimensional layout control.  
- **Responsive Design** – Optimized for various screen sizes.  
- **Layout Toggle Button** – A JavaScript-powered button switches the layout live without reloading the page.

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Semantic structure.  
- **CSS** – Custom styling and layout rules.  
- **JavaScript** – Interactive layout switching logic via `classList`.

## How to Use  
1. Open `grid-vs-flex.html` in any browser.  
2. Click the **"Switch to Flexbox/Grid"** button to toggle between layout systems.  
3. Observe how elements reposition based on the layout logic.

## Future Improvements

- Support for animations during layout transitions.  
- Enhanced mobile-first adaptations.
